# Personal-Discord-Bot-Project

The official unofficial place for the little test subject. Lots of things to try and test out here.

To-do:
- [x] Create a random number generator given bounds, for practicing JS
- [ ] Implement a sort of personal assistant, being capable of sending reminders, pulling weather data, being able to act as a timer, ect.
- [ ] THE BIG ONE: Machine learning driven applications, such as text generation, image generation, and more with TensorFlow.js and fed-in datasets
- [ ] and anything else that seems fun.
