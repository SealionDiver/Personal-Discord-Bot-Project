# Personal-Discord-Bot-Project

The official unofficial place for my little test subject. Lots of things to try and test out here.

To-do:
- [x] Create a random number generator given bounds, for practicing JS
- [ ] Implement a personal assistant, allowing the use of /remindme and /stopwatch, amongst other things
- [ ] THE BIG ONE: Machine learning driven chatbot that can dynamically respond with a degree of humanity to things said to it. This part gonna be difficult.
- [ ] and anything else I feel like putting into this.
